# Predictive Analysis for E-Commerce Website and Product Recommendation System


## About the Project
- Recommendation System is the knowledge discovery techniques and use of statistics to deliver users with personalized content and service. It is used to solve the interaction with the customers which are targeted to provide product recommendation issue. 
- We found this a challenging task to build a recommendation system. Customers these days are dependent on recommendations whether it is for products to purchase, news on recent launches, restaurants to visit or services to avail. 
- Recommender systems solve this problem of searching through large volume of dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized contents and services. 
- We found that more than half of the recommendation approaches applied content-based filtering (55 %). Collaborative filtering was applied by only 18 % of the reviewed approaches and graph-based recommendations by 16 %. 
- In this project, we attempt to understand different kind of algorithms for recommendation systems and compare their performance on E-commerce dataset. First, it remains unclear which recommendation concepts and approaches are most promising. 
- We tried to research deep into filtering techniques and apply for our dataset to evaluate recommender system adequately. 
- We have used Supervised Learning Algorithms, Collaborative Filtering Algorithms, Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis, Deep Learning and Stacked Ensemble model for our recommender system.

## Conclusion
- By using algorithms like content based filtering, we found similar reviews given by multiple users. 
- After using various algorithms, we concluded that Gradient Boosting Classifier, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) are most suitable for accurately predictions. 
- NLP using Bag of Words is very much suitable for our dataset and for performing the required sentiment analysis whereas ALS (Alternating Least Square) serves as a way to let us know products which are most likely to be recommended by the users. 
- Linear Regression and SVM (Support Vector Machine) are not suitable for the same since accuracy is way too way for it to qualify in our project.
